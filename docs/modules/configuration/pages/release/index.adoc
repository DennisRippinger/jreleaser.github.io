= Release

JReleaser can create and tag a release, upload all files and generate the changelog based on the new commits since
the previous tag. If a matching milestone is found then it'll be closed as well.

IMPORTANT: Only a single release service can be configured at a time.

You can choose from the following release services:

* xref:release/github.adoc[]
* xref:release/gitlab.adoc[]
* xref:release/gitea.adoc[]
* xref:release/codeberg.adoc[]
