= JReleaser's Release

It should be no surprise that JReleaser relies on itself to create its releases.

The following link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/main/jreleaser.yml[configuration file]
is used to create both release and snapshot releases:

# General information about this project
project:
  name: jreleaser
  description: Release Java projects quickly and easily with JReleaser
  longDescription: |
    JReleaser is a release automation tool for Java projects. Its goal is to simplify creating releases
    and publishing artifacts to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.

    JReleaser takes inputs from popular builds tools (Ant, Maven, Gradle) such as JAR files, binary
    distributions (.zip, .tar), JLink images, or any other file that youâ€™d like to publish as a Git
    release on popular Git services such as Github or Gitlab. Distribution files can additionally be
    published to be consumed by popular package managers as Homebrew, Snapcraft, or get ready to be
    launched via Jbang. Releases may be announced in a variety of channels such as Twitter, Zulip, or SdkMan!
