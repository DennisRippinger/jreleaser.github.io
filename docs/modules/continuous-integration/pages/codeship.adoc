JReleaser can be run as part of a link:https://app.codeship.com[CodeShip] pipeline.

NOTE: If you're already building with either Maven or Gradle then you might use the
xref:tools:jreleaser-maven.adoc[] or the xref:tools:jreleaser-gradle.adoc[] instead.

Add the following to the Deploy tab as a "custom script"

[source,shell]
----
# Configure Java 11 if the previous steps used an older version of Java
jdk_switcher home openjdk11
jdk_switcher use openjdk11

#Get the jreleaser downloader
curl -sL https://git.io/get-jreleaser > get_jreleaser.java

# Download JReleaser with version = <version>
# Change <version> to a tagged JReleaser release
# or leave it out to pull `latest`.

java get_jreleaser.java <version>

# Let's check we've got the right version
java -jar jreleaser-cli.jar --version

# Execute a JReleaser command such as 'full-release'
java -jar jreleaser-cli.jar full-release
----

TIP: You may use `latest` to pull the latest stable release or `early-access` to pull the latest snapshot.

NOTE: Use the Environment tab to configure environment variables such as `JRELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN` and any other secrets
required by the build.
